# Super-Hexagon-Remade
Grade 11 Culminating Project - written in Python

This is the game Super Hexagon remade by myself for my grade 11 Computer Science culminating project (2013-2014).
The original game is not free to play online, but the trailer and details about the game can be found here: http://superhexagon.com/

The game is made in Python using the PyGame library, which can be found here: http://pygame.org/hifi.html

There are two versions of my recreation of the game: with sound, and without sound. The version with sound uses audio from MonstercatMedia, whom are creditted within the game.

Keep in mind that this game was made before I was taught how to use classes, so there is not a single class used anywhere in my recreation of the game. Because of this, my code is very, very messy and quite amateur-ish. I haven't gotten around to completely rewriting the code, but I plan to do so using Java/Processing in the near future.
